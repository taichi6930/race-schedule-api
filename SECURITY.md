## Current Security Status

⚠️ **This project is currently in development and has known security issues that need to be addressed before production use.**

### Known Security Issues
- Missing authentication and authorization
- Input validation vulnerabilities
- Overly permissive IAM policies
- Credential exposure risks
- Missing security headers

**DO NOT use this application in production without addressing these security issues.**

## Security Improvements in Progress

We are actively working to address security issues identified in our security audit. See [SECURITY_ISSUES.md](SECURITY_ISSUES.md) for detailed information about:

1. **High Priority Issues**:
   - Hardcoded credential exposure
   - Missing input validation
   - No authentication/authorization
   - Overly permissive IAM policies
   - Error information leakage
   - Missing security headers

2. **Implementation Timeline**:
   - Phase 1 (Weeks 1-2): Critical security fixes
   - Phase 2 (Weeks 3-4): Authentication and validation
   - Phase 3 (Weeks 5-6): Security monitoring and headers

## Security Best Practices for Contributors

### Code Security
- Never commit secrets, API keys, or credentials
- Validate all inputs at application boundaries
- Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
- Implement proper error handling without information disclosure
- Follow the principle of least privilege

### Infrastructure Security
- Use AWS IAM roles with minimal required permissions
- Store secrets in AWS Secrets Manager or Parameter Store
- Enable logging and monitoring for security events
- Use HTTPS for all API communications
- Implement rate limiting and DDoS protection

### Development Security
- Keep dependencies updated
- Run security scans before committing
- Use secure development environments
- Follow secure coding guidelines
- Review code for security issues
